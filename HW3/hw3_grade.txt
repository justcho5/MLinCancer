9/9 criteria met

I used the following criteria from the assignment when grading (9 + extra credit):
    + Trained regression models on per drug basis with cross validation
    + Reported ACC/MSE, F1, AUC
        - Did not report F1/AUC, but ACC/R2 were shown
    + Clear choice or explained choice of SIR thresholds
    + Performed SIR classification
    + Reported top 10 and bottom 10 results by score

    + Retrained with one of CN, WES, or RACS
    + Improved / analyzed results

    + Reported top 10 drugs for cell lines
    + Scored rank against the provided data

    - (e.c.) Compared multi-drug model with previous results

Notes:
    ~24 hours late
    Did not report F1/AUC, but ACC/R2 were shown. The
    rest of the report was very well explained, so I
    treated it as a minor oversight.
