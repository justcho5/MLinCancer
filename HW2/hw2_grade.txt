6/6 criteria met + extra credit

I used the following criteria from the assignment when grading (6 + extra credit):
    + How you prepared the data for clustering.
    + What algorithms that you used for clustering.
    + How you visualized the clustering.
    + How you convinced yourself that the clustering was valid.
    + Any biological interpretations that you can associate with the clusters (extra credit).
    + Submitted code showing how you performed the above tasks.
    + Code had sufficient comments for understanding.

Notes:
    Used clusters to predict number of population subtypes of HNSC based on optimal number of clusters. Not the most detailed writeup, but it hit all the key points.
