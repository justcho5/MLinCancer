19/19 criteria met

I used the following 19 criteria from the assignment when grading:
    - Run TypeClassifier on tumor samples from NT
    - Add typed samples to TC
    - Retrain TypeClassifier on TC+
    - Reported results

    - Add normal samples from NT to TC+
    - Retrain TypeClassifier on TC++
    - Reported results

    - Run TypeClassifier++ on NT data
    - Report portion of misclassified normal samples
    - Explain results

    - Create new TypeClassifier that assigns types independent of NT
    - Reported results

    - Use unsupervised learning to cluster TC data
    - Assign unique types to each cluster
    - Train new TypeClassifier
    - Reported results

    - Build a NT labelled data generator
    - Test previous TypeClassifier on generated samples
    - Reported results

Notes:
    Very well structured and organized
